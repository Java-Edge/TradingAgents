I'll analyze social media, sentiment, and news data for SPY over the past week to provide a detailed report. Let me collect the latest information first. 

<thinking>
We're analyzing SPY (S&P 500 ETF) from June 30 to July 6, 2025. Since SPY tracks the S&P 500, we'll focus on:  
- Market-wide sentiment and news  
- Key sector movements  
- Macroeconomic indicators  
- Social media discussions about major index components  
The tool will provide curated news/sentiment data via our OpenAI integration.
