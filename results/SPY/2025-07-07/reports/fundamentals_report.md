I'll analyze the fundamental information for SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) over the past week using the available tool. Since SPY is an ETF tracking the S&P 500 index, its fundamentals depend on the aggregate health of its underlying holdings.

First, I'll fetch the required data using the tool:
```json
{
  "tool": "get_fundamentals_openai",
  "parameters": {
    "symbol": "SPY",
    "details": "company_profile,basic_financials,financial_history,insider_transactions,financial_documents"
  }
}
```
