I'll begin by using the available tools to gather the latest economic and market news relevant to SPY (S&P 500 ETF). Since we're analyzing the past week, I'll search for news from June 30 to July 7, 2025.

First, I'll retrieve broad macroeconomic news using the OpenAI global news tool: 
```json
[
  {
    "name": "get_global_news_openai",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "macroeconomic trends United States inflation interest rates GDP employment",
      "start_date": "2025-06-30",
      "end_date": "2025-07-07"
    }
  }
]
```

Next, I'll focus specifically on SPY-related market developments using Google News: 
```json
[
  {
    "name": "get_google_news",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "SPY OR S&P 500 market analysis",
      "period": "7d"
    }
  }
]
```

After gathering this data, I'll synthesize the key developments into a structured report with these sections:
1. Central Bank Policy Shifts 
2. Economic Indicators 
3. Sector-Specific Developments 
4. Geopolitical Influences 
5. Market Technical Analysis 
6. Forward Outlook

The report will conclude with a Markdown table summarizing key takeaways for traders holding or considering SPY positions.
